# Welcome to the nx Gamepad project

The **nx Gamepad** project is an open-source initiative that aims to build a framework for game developers to effortlessly integrate versatile gamepad controls across various devices into their games.

Second-screen experiences which were previously almost exclusive to major console platforms can now be achieved by either equipping smartphones with mobile controllers or using modern handhelds to serve as gamepads for more stationary devices.

## Resources

At its core is the Flutter plugin [n_gamepad](https://github.com/nx-gamepad/n_gamepad), enabling developers to easily implement a unified gamepad integration. Complementing this plugin will be a library, which supports various programming languages to process inputs from connected gamepads.

The following repositories ensure the consistency of our libraries by publicly maintaining demo codebases of our vision for corresponding apps:

- [**tx Gamepad** - Concrete implementation of the Flutter plugin](https://github.com/nx-gamepad/tx_gamepad)
- [**rx Gamepad** - Example for a specific input server application](https://github.com/nx-gamepad/rx_gamepad)
